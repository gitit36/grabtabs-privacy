        <h1>GrabTabs Refund Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>
        
        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>This Refund Policy applies to all subscription purchases made through <strong>onp0int</strong> for the GrabTabs service. Payments are processed through Paddle, a third-party payment processor. This policy complies with Paddle's Buyer Terms, which require a minimum 14-day refund policy for consumers.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Consumer Right to Cancel (14-Day Cooling-Off Period)</h2>
        <p>If you are a Consumer (purchasing for personal use), you have the right to cancel your subscription and receive a full refund within <strong>14 days</strong> of your initial purchase without giving any reason. The 14-day cancellation period begins the day after you complete your purchase.</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 How to Cancel</h3>
        <p>To cancel your subscription and request a refund within the 14-day period:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact us at <strong>support@onp0int.com</strong> with your order details</li>
            <li>Include your account email address and transaction ID</li>
            <li>We will process your refund request promptly</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.2 Refund Processing</h3>
        <p>If you cancel within the 14-day period:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will reimburse all payments received from you</li>
            <li>Refunds will be processed without undue delay, and no later than 14 days after we receive your cancellation request</li>
            <li>Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase</li>
            <li>You will not incur any fees as a result of the refund</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.3 Exception to the 14-Day Right</h3>
        <p>Your right to cancel does not apply if you have already started using the subscription service and have had the benefit of the Product. Since GrabTabs is a digital service that provides immediate access upon purchase, your right to cancel may be limited once you have actively used the service features.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Subscription Plans</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Monthly and Annual Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>For <strong>Pro Monthly</strong> ($3.99/month) and <strong>Pro Annual</strong> ($36/year) subscriptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may cancel your subscription at any time through the Manage Subscription page in the extension</li>
            <li>For initial subscriptions: You have 14 days from purchase to request a full refund (subject to the exception above)</li>
            <li>For automatic renewals: Your right to cancel applies only to the initial subscription, not to each automatic renewal</li>
            <li>Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period</li>
            <li>You will retain access to subscription features until the end of the paid period</li>
            <li>No refunds are provided for partial billing periods after the 14-day cooling-off period</li>
            <li>If you cancel before the end of your billing period, you will continue to have access until the period ends, but you will not be charged for the next period</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.2 Lifetime Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>For <strong>Lifetime</strong> ($79 one-time) subscriptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have 14 days from purchase to request a full refund (subject to the exception above)</li>
            <li>After the 14-day period, Lifetime subscriptions are final and non-refundable</li>
            <li>This policy applies due to the one-time nature of the purchase and the immediate access to all features</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Refund Requests</h2>
        <h3>4.1 General Policy</h3>
